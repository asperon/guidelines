# HTML

## Syntax
* Use soft tabs with two spaces—they're the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment.
* Nested elements should be indented once (two spaces).
* Always use double quotes, never single quotes, on attributes.
* Don't include a trailing slash in self-closing elements—the HTML5 spec says they're optional.
* Don’t omit optional closing tags (e.g. `</li>` or `</body>`).
